# Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) Backward Search Run-Length Encoded (RLE)

- Efficient Search Algorithm Development:
  - Created a C++ program to perform BWT backward search directly on run-length encoded files without decoding.
  - Implemented techniques including suffix arrays, FM index, and RLFM to optimize the search process.
- Performance Optimization:
  - Achieved low time complexity, ensuring search operations completed in less than 10 seconds.
  - Maintained run-time memory usage under 13MB when processing 160MB files, demonstrating efficient memory management.
- Advanced Data Compression and Search Techniques:
  - Utilized the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) for efficient data compression and search operations.
  - Integrated run-length encoding (RLE) with BWT to enhance compression efficiency and support direct search on compressed data.
- Testing and Validation:
  - Conducted rigorous testing to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the search algorithm on large data sets.
  - Ensured the program's robustness and reliability, handling various data types and sizes effectively.
